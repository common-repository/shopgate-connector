"Why Going Mobile Should Top Your To-Do List"

Did you know?  One out of every two consumers makes their latest purchase on a mobile device. That’s a double-take statistic, and online retailers ignore it at their peril. App customers are remarkably loyal to their favorite brands. On average, 55% more so than a typical desktop shopper. Now, eCommerce retailers are beginning to understand the gravity of providing customers with the best possible mobile experience. 

Shopgate builds and deploys apps and mobile websites that are in tune with your existing online store strategy. Shopgate apps and websites are adapted to suit the very different needs of Apple and Android devices. Your products should be accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their personal technology preferences. We provide the ideal, all-in-one solution for merchants who don’t have the resources for expensive in-house development and agency services.

"A Universal Mobile Solution for a World of Business"

Shopgate makes it easy to integrate your store with our platform, which makes it a no-brainer choice for businesses of any size. In just few clicks, all your store’s data, content and products will be migrated to your new mobile versions. 

We support all the leading eCommerce platforms, making Shopgate the universally smart solution for businesses that are eager to get mobile—and fast. Also from the “hassle-free” file, Shopgate can easily integrate the payment systems you already use, while offering up-to-the-minute augmentations to keep you competitive. That’s what we call “the best of both worlds.”

"Customized Mobile Tools You Can Bank On"

Individual Branding & Separate Landing Pages
Custom design the style of your app, mobile website and landing pages to match your goals and brand image. 

Smart Banners: Map to Your App
With a simple meta tag you can integrate a smart banner to your mobile website, which intrigues your customers and leads them directly to your mobile app.

Push Notifications Remind Users to Follow Your Path to Conversion
We’re all familiar with this phenomenon: You have no intention of shopping today, then, suddenly, your phone alerts you to a half-off-everything sale and you find yourself clicking through with gusto. Shopgate lets you send push notification offers directly to your customer's smartphone. 

Easy Administration and No. New. Downloads.
Your Shopgate mobile store may look sophisticated, whimsical, minimal, ornate—anything you like. It’s your brand! But it's also extremely simple to launch and maintain as your own SaaS solution. Download additional software? No way. This isn’t 2005.

"Innovate with Shopgate"

In 2007, the first iPhone was born. Almost immediately, eCommerce was redefined forever.  With 40 million monthly visitors and experience facilitating the promotions of over 35 million products, Shopgate has keen insight into industry. Our teams are always on the lookout for what will redefine the industry next. 

Shopgate’s 170 employees—most of whom are developers—take pride in actively shaping the future of commerce. Newly innovated features and buzz-worthy mobile trends can be automatically incorporated into your app. This natural adaptability makes the development of expensive new app versions totally unnecessary. Today, more than 15,000 eCommerce businesses rely on our enthusiasm, agility and expertise.
